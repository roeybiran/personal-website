title: About
---

I’m a graduate visual communications designer and self–taught indie developer. I’m interested in building macOS apps, websites and web apps, automation, crafting well–formed APIs, and creating excellent user experiences. I have a great passion for fine typography and icon design. I’m also an avid self–learner and a voracious reader.
