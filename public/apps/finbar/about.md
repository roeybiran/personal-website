## Does one thing, and does it well

## Adapts to you

Finbar will remember every menu item you’ve selected, accumulating a list of your most used (and most recently used) menu items over time. The list remains relevant across launches, and even when a given menu item has a dynamic, varying title.

## Extensible

Got `shell` or `AppleScript` scripts? Put them in a specially–designated folder and Finbar will integrate them with the rest of the menu items — essentially a way for you to extend the menu bar with custom “menu items” of your own.
