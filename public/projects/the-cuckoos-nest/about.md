An immersive, interactive VR experience inspired by a renowned scene from Miloš Forman's 1975 film, [One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/).

The project was created as part of “Masaryk Square, Relationship in Motion Exhibition”, a collaboration between my faculty and the University of West Bohemia in the Czech Republic. This virtual exhibition was launched to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the renewal of diplomatic relations between the Israel and the Czech Republic. Students were asked to design VR experiences relating to key figures with cultural ties to both countries (Forman was a Czech Jew).
