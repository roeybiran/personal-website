Syphon requires the following system permissions to operate properly:

1. Accessibility
   - For registering global hotkeys.
   - For getting an app's windows and their properties (like titles).
   - For carrying actions on app windows, like showing and minimizing them.

2. Screen recording
   - For capturing previews of window contents.

Syphon doesn't do any further processing of this data, nor persists it anywhere â€” the data never leaves your Mac.
