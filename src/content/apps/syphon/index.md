**Syphon** is an opinionated application switcher engineered for simplicity and efficiency. Simply pop up the panel, type a few characters (ideally just one), activate the app you need, and get back to work. If this workflow resonates with you, you’ll probably find Syphon useful.

The design philosophy is straightforward: on the surface, Syphon maintains a similar look–and–feel to the Mac’s built–in app switcher, but allows you to gradually unsheathe its powers and have control over the interplay between the familiar and the advanced. You decide whether the search field is always shown, or only while typing. You decide whether hidden apps are placed in their own section; and whether Syphon will serve purely as a window switcher, app switcher, or both.

## Features

### Fuzzy Search

Simply start typing to enter Syphon’s search mode, which lists all running apps, their windows, and even installed apps — all just three keystrokes away.

### Organize

Keep your the most important stuff front and center by optionally putting hidden apps and minimized windows in distinct sections.

### Window Switching

Use a dedicated hotkey to list the windows of the frontmost app or perform a fuzzy search across all windows from all applications, both feature large, clear window previews[^1]. Seamlessly switch between app and window modes without having to reactivate Syphon.

### App Launcher

Ever opened the Mac’s app switcher to activate an app, only to realize it’s not running? Syphon solves this by searching both installed and running apps. Selecting a non–running app it will launch it, allowing you to stay in the flow.

### Actions

Quit, hide or unhide apps; close, minimize or un–minimize windows — all through Syphon using familiar hotkeys, without distrupting its core feature: fuzzy search.

### One Keystroke Activation

While in Syphon’s search mode, simply hold the last key you pressed to instantly select the top search result. Surely among the fastest ways to switch to an app or window on the Mac!

### Adaptive

Syphon learns from your habits and gets smarter with use. If you’re a designer working in [Figma](https://figma.com) regularly and type “fi” into Syphon’s search field, it’ll understand that you **probably** want to open the design tool and not, for example, Finder.

[^1]: Window previews are supported on macOS Sonoma and later.
