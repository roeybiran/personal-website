## Troubleshooting

### If pressing Escape doesn't dismiss Syphon in macOS Tahoe

A new system keyboard shortcut called "Game Overlay" was added in macOS Tahoe, which is bound to <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⎋</kbd> by default. If the modifier key you're using to activate Syphon is <kbd>⌘</kbd>, the new system shortcut might prevent Escape from dismissing Syphon. To work around this, go to "System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts…", and untick "Game Overlay" shortcut, or assign a different key combination to it.
