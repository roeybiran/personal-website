**Finbar** puts the entirety of the frontmost application’s [menu bar](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/system-experiences/the-menu-bar) at your disposal. With blazing–fast performance, fantastic fuzzy search capabilities and smart caching, you’ll unleash a new level of productivity by having immediate access to every single command a given application has to offer. It’s like having your very own [command palette](https://capiche.com/e/consumer-dev-tools-command-palette), in every app.

## Highlights

### Fast

Finbar is designed to do one thing, and do it well. **Built exclusively with native Apple technologies**, it’ll retrieve your desired menu item lightning–fast. And when not in use, it awaits patiently in its own little spot in the menu bar, taking virtually no resources.

### Smart

Finbar remembers every menu item you’ve selected, gradually accumulating a list of your favorite menu items. This list stays relevant across launches, and even when menu items have a dynamic, varying title.

### Expert Navigator

![navigation](./navigation.jpg)

Traverse even the most complex of menu bars with just a few keystrokes: Finbar turns every menu bar into a browsable outline, just like the Finder does for your file system. Plus, selecting menu items containing other items will scope the search just to the nested items.

### Configurable

![the rule editor](./rule-editor.jpg)

Tailor search results exactly to your needs. Exclude menu items by properties like **title**, **path** and **depth**, or by the owning application. Combine rules to create endlessly intricate configurations, and never see an irrelevant menu item again.

### Extensible

![scripts](./scripts.jpg)

Any `shell` or `AppleScript` scripts placed inside a specially–designated folder will be integrated with the rest of the menu items — essentially a way for you to extend the menu bar with custom “menu items” of your own.
